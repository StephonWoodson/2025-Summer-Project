## Stephon's 2025 Project
The goal of this project is to model the heart. The following things will be modeled:
-Mass flow rate of blood pumped by the heart
- BloodPressure = cardiacOutput * totalPeripheralResistance
- cardiacOutput = VO2 / (Ca -Cv)
- VO2 can be an independent variable for the first iteration of the heart model
