## Stephon's 2025 Project
The goal of this project is to model plaque buildup within a coronary artery. The following things will be modeled:
- Plaque buildup within a coronary artery
- Change in pressure as a result of plaque buildup
- Graphs demonstrating change in blood pressure
- Bernoulli's Equation
- Cross Sectional Area
- Gaussian Distribution


## How to use properly use the software
# Bernoullis Equation
Change the variable of velocity at point 2 (V2) to a number within a reasonable range of blood velocity within an artery. If number is too high, or low the code will produce unrealistic numbers. Ensure that you properly convert your units into m/s. Blood density(p) is a constant that does not need to undergo any changes. Pressure at point 1(P1) can be changed within realisitc expectations. Velocity at point 1(V1) will always be zero. Under no circumstances should this number change otherwise the equation will be inaccurate 

# Continuity Equation
Change the cross-sectional area (A2) and volumetric flow rate (Q) to realistic numbers with correct units in order to observe changes within blood pressure. Blood density (p) should not change as it is constant. Changes in pressure at point 1 (P1) will still allow the code to run properly as long as the changes are within a realistic range and maintain proper units.

# Gaussian Distribution
